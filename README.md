# Solved: deletion issue 
method `deleteObjectsOnTable` in `simulator.py`  uses `remove_object_by_handle()` from rigidObjectManager. 
Does not remove object as shown with method `loadSingleBanana` in `clutterLoader.py`. 
Images are saved to folder output/banana.

Objects are from the YCB dataset and the apartment scene is from the replicaCAD dataset.
